# HDFC Current Account



##Eligibility

You are eligible to operate a Current Account if you fall under any of the following categories:
* 
Resident Individual
* 
Sole Proprietorship Firms
* 
Partnership Firms
* 
Private and Public Limited Companies

##Documents Checklist 

* 
Partnership Deed of the startup.
* 
Company PAN Card
* 
Address Proof of Partners as per KYC norms (Passport/Aadhar Card/Driving License/Voters Identity Card)
* 
PAN Card of all the partners
* 
3 Passport photos of each Partner.

##Process

With HDFC having a digital current bank account opening system, an account can be opened by duly filling an [online application](https://goo.gl/sg8EaZ).  

An account number will be texted to the registered mobile number within 15 minutes of applying and once all concerned documents are physically verified by a bank official (within 24 hours), the account will be live.

***Important: ***The current account offered by HDFC is not Zero Balance. An amount of INR 10,000 has to be deposited to the account while opening. However, an option that can be exercised by startups is to instruct the HDFC agent to convert the deposit into a Fixed Deposit against which the firm can be issued a Credit Card of 85% of the value of the deposit (INR 8,500 in this case).
