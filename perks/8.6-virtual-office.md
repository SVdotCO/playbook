# Virtual Office

Every SV.CO incubate apart from being part of a thriving ecosystem can also avail the following facilities:

##Business Address

For all official purposes (visiting cards, website and mailing address) the startup may provide their office address as that of Startup Village, Cochin. All mails/other communication received for the startup at Startup Village can be collected from the Reception Desk. However this address should not be used as the address for registering the startup.

##Conference Room

Startups can use the Startup Village Conference Room for meetings, networking or investor pitches. The requirement will have to be notified to the SV.CO team atleast a week in advance and is subject to availability.
