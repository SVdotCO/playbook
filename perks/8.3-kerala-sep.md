# Kerala Student Entrepreneurship Policy

## Eligibility

All these four conditions have to be met:
  
* Should be a founder.
* Should be a student.
* Should be studying for a bachelor degree. 
* Should be enrolled in any college[^1] in Kerala.
  
Note: **only founders of startups are eligible**, employees are not.

Founders should have a [legal agreement with SV.CO](2-legal-agreement.md)[^2] in place to claim this benefit.

SEP benefits are being offered through a scheme sponsored by the Kerala Government. Note that while we've noted down the process below to the best of our knowledge, it's your University that ultimately awards you these benefits.

## Grace Marks & Attendance Relaxation Offered

| Tier No. | Tier | Grace Marks | Attendance |
|-----------|------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Once you complete the [Idea Discovery stage](stages/5.1-idea-discovery.md). | 1% | 5% |
| 2 | Once a legal company entity (Partnership or Pvt.Ltd.) has been formed. | 1% | 5% |
| 3 | Once you complete the [Prototyping stage](stages/5.2-prototyping.md). | 2% | 10% | 

All grace marks and attendance received are *cumulative*, i.e.: at Tier 2, you will receive 2% grace marks and 10% attendance, and at Tier 3, you will receive a total of **4% grace marks and 20% attendance**. 

Three important things to note: 

* If you haven't claimed this benefit before, and you are already at the Customer Validation stage, it's not a problem. Once you claim this benefit, you'll receive the entire Tier 1-3 benefits at a go.
* You can only claim this benefit **once every semester**. So, as an example, if you claim the benefit for Tier No. 1 in Semester 5, you cannot claim any futher benefits in that semester. However, once you advance to Semester 6, you can claim Tier No. 2 (or even Tier No. 3) benefits.
* You can't claim a benefit under this scheme retrospectively, i.e: if you are in Semester 6, it's not possible to claim a benefit under this scheme for Semester 5. So make sure you apply well ahead of semester closing (at least 3 months before is what we recommend.)

## Application Process

Claiming benefits at every Tier requires a [Verified Timeline](3-verified-timelines.md) entry as proof:

* If you are applying for Tier 1 benefit, then your deck has to be verified by Startup Village. This is automatic if your startup has been approved, and your Verified Timeline is at the Prototyping stage.
* If you are applying for the Tier 2 benefit, then your timeline should have a verified *Incorporated Company* entry.
* If you are applying for Tier 3 benefit, then your timeline should have a verified *Finished Prototype Demo* entry.

Once you're sure your timeline has these verified entries, this is the process to follow:

1. Download the [Application Forms available here](http://www.slideshare.net/svlabs/student-entrepreneurship-policy-application-forms). 
   
   Note: **M.G. University students** have a [different version that is available here](http://www.slideshare.net/svlabs/mg-university-student-entrepreneurship-policy-application-forms).
   
   This document has three forms that you have to print out and fill in.
2. Make sure you have 3 passport-sized photographs.
3. Submit a completed *Nodal Agency Certification Form* (in person) along with a copy of your College ID to Startup Village at the Kochi location.
4. Wait for Startup Village to certify and sign these forms and hand it back to you. If your timeline entries are in order, this shouldn't take too long.
5. Submit a completed *College/Instutition Recommendation Letter* to your college. This has to be signed and certified by your college Principal (or Institution Head).
6. Once you've received both these signed & verified forms, submit them to the University with an additional completed *University Request Form*.

That's it! At Startup Village, we usually process SEP requests within 7 days. We've noticed that Universities usually take a minimum of 2 months to process the SEP application.

**Important note**: While we think the SEP programme is great for young founders to receive benefits for their entrepreneurship achievements, you should not join SV.CO just to receive these benefits. We are quick to weed out such founders, and we'll not approve a sub-par Deck or Prototype just so that you can receive some grace marks.

Please also [read the FAQ](9-faq.md) (the SEP section) that has questions on this SEP program.
