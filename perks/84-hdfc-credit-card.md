# HDFC Credit Card


##Eligibility

Partnership Firms are automatically eligible for an HDFC Credit Card if they have a Current Account operating with the bank.

##Documents Checklist 

To open a Current Account with HDFC the following documents need to be presented by the firm:

* 
Partnership Deed
* 
Company PAN CARD
* 
Address Proof of Partners 
* 
Partners PAN CARD
* 
3 Passport photos of each Partner.

##Process (Current Account)

With HDFC having a digital current bank account opening system, an account can be opened by duly filling an  [online application](http://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/products/accounts-and-deposits/current-accounts/regular-current-account).

An account number will be texted to the registered mobile number within 15 minutes of applying and once all concerned documents are physically verified by a bank official (within 24 hours), the account will be live.

##Process (Credit Card)

The current account offered by HDFC is not Zero Balance. An amount of INR 10,000 has to be deposited to the account while opening. However, an option that can be exercised by startups is to instruct the HDFC agent to convert the deposit into a Fixed Deposit against which the firm can be issued a Credit Card of 85% of the value of the deposit (INR 8,500 in this case). 

Startups may vary the amount of the Fixed Deposit depending upon the limit of the Credit Card they require.
