# Customer Validation
When a large amount of customers use and give feedback on your product, startups hit the Customer Validation stage. The aim of this stage to hit a *Product-Market fit*. Defined simply, Product-Market fit happens when the market (your customers) pay enough money or attention to your product to justify its creation. But, how much is good enough?

## Defining Validation

Customer Validation is an important milestone towards value creation because this is where you define metrics for your product that serves as success indicators. For every startup, these metrics are different, but there are a few common groupings:

* Monthly Active Users (or MAU) is a standard metric that is used to track customer attention. Typically, you will decide a threshold of MAUs to be reached for the product to move into the next stage, and also track the rate of change for this metric.
* Cohort Analysis is crucial to properly measuring Validation. Cohort analysis is where startups measure user behavior by segmenting them into groups, usually ordered by when they joined. This gives a clear picture of whether iterations of your product improve engagement.
* Qualitative metrics can also be useful towards validation. Asking users questions after success and failure scenarios can collect quite a bit of data that might be useful to pivot your product. In addition, monitoring open forums where customer can give feedback (social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook, or specific user forums such as Uservoice) is also important.

While these are the types of metrics that are important, only you can decide the targets for these metrics because they vary widely based on the type of startup and the industry you are in. To get help on setting targets, talk to mentors at SV.CO. 

For the Customer Validation stage, the Product, the Marketing & Sales and the Governance roles are equally important.

## Typical Activities
These are the typical milestones in the Customer Validation stage:

* Refinement of Features
* User growth
* Metrics and Analytics implementation
* Seed funding
* Hiring Key Employees				
* Pivots (if necessary)
* First paying customers
* Product-market fit

## Average Duration
The average duration for the Customer Validation stage is 6-12 months.

## Objective
The Team Objective at this Stage is to get early customer validation.

## Key Result
The Key Result is to have early customers using the product and giving feedback.

Let's take a look now at individual roles and how that leads to the above Key Result:

## Product Role

The Product person has an important role to play during Customer Validation. It's he who decides experiments to perform during this stage, and who along with the team decides metrics the team has to hit before moving on.

* [Erli Bird](http://erlibird.com) is a community where product folks can reach customers and get actionable feedback.
* [Keyword Tool](http://keywordtool.io) provides you an avenue to perform great SEO.
* Github and [Deprivation Testing](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3010972/open-company/how-github-uses-deprivation-testing-to-hone-product-design) is a great read on an innovative way to test with customers. 

## Engineering Role

The Engineering person provides support to others and is focused on implementing experiments quickly and thoughtfully. It's important that Engineers focus on building a stable and quick-to-iterate platform with little technical debt.

Resources:

* Engineers must understand frameworks available for [A/B Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), a crucial tool available during this stage to design experiments.
* A good familiarity with the [NIH Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) is essential. Put simply, instead of reinventing the wheel, learn how other companies solve similar problems and adopt their tools and solutions.
* Setting up [Continuous Integration](http://youandthegang.com/2015/continuous-integration-delivery-with-jenkins/) at this stage is nice!
* [Librato](https://www.librato.com) is an easy turnkey solution to collect metrics. It's built on top of the open-source [Collectd](https://collectd.org) and [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com). [Grafana](http://grafana.org) is an alternative to Librato that is free.


## Marketing & Sales Role

The moment of truth whether customers would want to use your product is an exciting discovery process. This is the first step where you get a clear indiciation whether your current version of the idea will succeed or fail. If you are a first time founder with little or zero industry experience, the chances of failure at this stage are high and that is perfectly normal and OK. 

The key tasks at this stage is to get your prototype to as many early customers as possible and get feedback from them. The feedback from actual customers who will be future users can teach you more at this stage than any online resource. 

The way to do meet actual customers is too simple - setup appointments with prospective customers and go meet them to find if they are intersted in your product. Steve Blank calls this key step as [Getting out of the building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-J_SwmMJyo) since there is no information you can gain by sitting with your team inside a building.

If you are creating a product that is technically challenging, a great way to see if customers want your product is to create a simple demo video of the how the product works. 

Dropbox [setup a demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-J_SwmMJyo) of how their product would work, without writing code or building the actual product, and then created a link for early users to signup which saw their waiting list zoom from 5000 to 75000 users in a single day.

For hardware startups, launching a crowd-funding campaign on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) or [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com) is a great way to see if there are early customers who want the product and achieve customer validation.

As leaders, you need to know how to handle failures and also learn how to get up and start again. Just like a boxing match, you don't fail if you fall down. You fail and get defeated only if you don't get up.

* Using [Validation to build the right product](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2013/09/validate-or-die-using-validation-to-build-the-right-product/) has great insights on validating the demand, problem and your solution.

## Governance Role
As the team starts to have customers, some of whom might be paying, it is time to raise invoices and start building the basic financial statements called profit and loss statement, cash-flow statement and balance sheet.

Every employee (including the founders) will need to have an employment agreement with the company.

As a private limited company, the team also needs to appoint a Sexual Harassment Committee to comply with legal requirements.

The next step in building the team culture is to find out how to keep the motivation levels high and learning about creating your own tribe.

* [Understanding Financial Statements](http://www.slideshare.net/evenanerd/understanding-financial-statements) is a great slideshare presentation to understand basics of startup finance.

* [Tribal Leadership](http://emergentbydesign.com/2012/06/28/a-step-by-step-guide-to-tribal-leadership-part-1-the-five-stages-of-tribal-culture/) is an quick overview of the types of cultures that exists in companies which will help you decide which culture you want to create in your startup

## Design Role

The person who handles Design can use this stage to try out different UX experiments. It's also crucial to build a company-wide design language that everybody can adopt when building new interfaces. Because this might be a time of quick iteration, designers must also learn how to make quick and dirty experiments work great.

Resources:

* Product Hunt has a collection of [tools for designers](http://www.producthunt.com/e/tools-for-designers) that could become super useful at this stage.

## Common Failures

* The biggest reason why startups fail at this stage is that they spend too much on customer acquisition before product-market fit. At this stage, you are still looking to find viable customers for your product.
* Building a product without problem/solution fit.
* Hiring too many people too early, or hiring "experts" before they become critical.

## Proceeding to Efficiency

Once you've hit your target metrics and you have a viable business plan in mind, move on to [Efficiency](5.4-efficiency.md).
