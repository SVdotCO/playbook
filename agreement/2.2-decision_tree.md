# Decision Tree

This chapter aims to assist you in making an informed decision on whether SV.CO is a right fit for you and your team. This exercise would be fruitful only if you answer all the questions with utmost honesty.

**Q1.** **Are you a first time founder?**

*If you answered "Yes" *

Great Our expertise is in mentoring and handholding first time founders and ensuring they have an amazing experience building a startup while picking up key entrepreneurial skills.

*If you answered "No"*

Sorry, our program is designed to cater to first time founders and a majority of our intake is from students who are still enrolled in college.

**2.** **Have you read through this Playbook?**

*If you answered "Yes" * 

That’s good work. This is important for you to answer the questions that follow. The Playbook has been compiled by Subject Matter Experts and Faculty who have been entrepreneurs and mentors to successful startups.

*If you answered "No"*

Since you are a first time founder, the Playbook would be a great read for you. Also in order to truly understand what the program is all about, it is essential you read the Playbook thoroughly. The next set of questions would be meaningless without completing this activity. 

**Q3. Do you understand the benefits you receive when you join SV.CO?**

*If you answered "Yes" * 

SV.CO endeavors to provide you experiences outside a preset curriculum that are meant to skill you as an entrepreneur and train you to be future ready by providing graduation options that differ from what is offered in a normal university course.

*If you answered "No"*

Please clear out all doubts you have. You can get in touch with us at help@sv.co. You should only be joining if you think what SV.CO has to offer is a right fit for you. You could also go through our Playbook again.
(Concentrate on chapters [1](http://playbook.sv.co/1-partnership.html), [3](http://playbook.sv.co/3-verified-timelines.html), [7](http://playbook.sv.co/7-graduation.html) and [8](http://playbook.sv.co/8-perks.html))

**Q4. Have you understood all commitments the startup team will have towards SV.CO depending upon its success?**

*If you answered "Yes" * 

These commitments are to ensure self-sustainability of SV.CO, a startup in itself and are only applicable on your success due to our efforts.

*If you answered "No"*

We urge you to go through the [legal agreements](http://playbook.sv.co/2-legal-agreement.html) again and consult with any expert for gaining insights on the clauses. You can also write to help@sv.co.

**Q5. Are you a fast learner and interested about technology and startups?**

*If you answered "Yes" * 

That’s good news. The entrepreneurial journey is marked with steep learning curves, with having to pick up key skills on the go while learning to build a startup. You have to be a hustler with an aptitude for what you are doing and good with managing your time to be a part of this Program.

*If you answered "No"*

If you feel you can not handle a hectic schedule  and/or technology is not your cup of tea, SV.CO is not the apt platform for you.

**Q6. Do you think being successful means getting funding for your startup?**

*If you answered "Yes"* 

As you might have read in the previous chapters, SV.CO offers [six ways to graduate](http://playbook.sv.co/7-graduation.html).  We consider all 6 ways of graduation equally relevant. Getting funded is one of the 6 options and not the only option for graduation.

Even if you answered Yes, be conscious that a co-founder in your team might choose differently, and that's completely OK.

*If you answered "No"*

There are 5 other graduation options for you/your team to choose from. Make an informed decision based on personal evaluation and open discussions with yourself, your team, friends and family. SV.CO—first and foremost—is intended to improve your skills through building great products and learning entrepreneurship.
