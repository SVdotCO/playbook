##What is a current Account?
In banking terminology, the term Current Account refers to a type of deposit account made with a financial institution that permits the withdrawal of funds and allows checks to be written against the balance.

In the retail market, a Current Account is a relatively safe investment when opened with an insured and regulated financial institution like a bank, building society, savings and loan corporation, or credit union. Most current accounts do not pay interest on the funds deposited in them since they can be withdrawn at any time without advance notice or penalty.
