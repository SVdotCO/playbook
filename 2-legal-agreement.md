# The Legal Agreement

Once your application is accepted, you sign a legal agreement between your founding team and Startup Village that lays out how the SV.CO platform will help you build great products, and what your team will offer SV.CO in return.

Note: everything in this page is a best-effort human-readable version of the legal agreement, but it does not replace the agreement you sign. If you have any doubts, please talk to your SV.CO representative.

Startup Village offers you:

* An online learning platform that describes the various stages that your go through while building your startup. [Curated resources](https://sv.co/resources) are also available to guide you through your journey. It has information on the common pitfalls that startups make at every stage and the most common activities that successful startups perform at every stage. In addition, [a team of experts at Startup Village](https://sv.co/faculty) have curated learning material available into the five roles that every startup should have: a great *product-oriented* person, sound *engineering* skills, marketing and *sales*, good *governance*, and great *design* and user experience.
* A [verified timeline](https://sv.co/startups) where you can record life events in your startup journey. Startup Village will verify each of these events to make sure that an external investor or mentor can see your authentic startup journey.
* Access to funding events on separate selection criteria to be announced at each such event. As an example, we might have seed rounds where only startups in the Prototype and Customer Validation stages are eligible.
* Access to community events on a separate selection criteria. Startup Village plays host to dozens of events and expert visits a month. You can see a [small sample of them on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheStartupVillage).
* We have exciting mentorship programs that we are currently building. Teams who are in more advanced stages of their startup journey can apply for programs such as [Startup Studio](http://startupstudio.co.in).
* Office space at our partner Kochi and Vishakapatanam locations. Please note that there is a separate fee for access, and the fee structure for these spaces changes often.
* A Virtual Office address for all registered startups.
* Limited use of the Startup Village brand as per [separate brand guidelines](perks/8.8-brand-usage.md).

In return for these benefits, Startup Village charges a *recurring per-semester fee* to founders, and an *optional success-based fee* when founders and startups succeed.

The *recurring per-semester fee* is currently ₹75,000. Note: we will be offering a lot of scholarships for our first few batches *where this fee will be entirely waived*.

The optional success-based fee is where founders and startups pay only when SV.CO helps them succeed. We call this fee structure 2.5/5/10/20/30, and it's very simple to understand:

* When we introduce you to a potential investor, and the investor puts in money into your startup, you agree to pay us 2.5% of the funding round as arrangers fee.
* When you receive business leads to customers through our introductions, you agree to pay us 5% of the total revenue generated through that lead for the first 3 years.
* When you are hired through our platform where we offer job fairs & placements, you'll agree to pay us 10% of your annual salary for the first year.
* When your team gets acqui-hired through our platform when we connect you to prospective acquirers, you'll agree to pay us 20% of your combined compensation received.
* When your team receives funding, you'll agree that Startup Village can participate in up to 30% of that funding round at a 30% discount on your funding valuation. This scenario is explained in detail in our [Raising Investment](6-raising-investment.md) chapter.

All agreements have a validity of 5 years. This includes the six months where we provide you intensive help to complete a product-iteration cycle, and five years where we provide graduation support.

A note on the fee structure: we strongly believe that Startup Village will only succeed as an organization if our fee-structure is **aligned with your success**. Case in point: our success-based fee model for funded startups does not ask for equity beforehand: only when you approach a funding round, and even then after we put in money ourselves.

## Legal Agreements

There is one agreement that every founder has to sign with SV.CO:

* **Agreement for Educational Services to Startups**

   This agreement is to be signed by all founders of the startup.
   
   Note: this requires founders to register a partnership. [We have a template Partnership Deed](http://www.slideshare.net/svlabs/startup-partnership-deed) available. This is not a very complex process: your SV.CO representative can help you start a partnership.

### Agreement for Educational Services to Startups

This agreement is to be signed by all founders of the startup:

## Signing the Agreement

Once you read and understand these agreements, write to help@sv.co or ping your SV.CO representative [on the Public Slack forum](1.2-slack.md) to arrange a date to visit Startup Village and sign these agreements.

All founders have to be present at Startup Village premises to sign agreements & should carry a valid Photo ID Proof.

## Fee for Agreement Signing

This is an actual fee to meet legal expenses

Fee = 100 + 5000[^3] 

## Next Steps
Once you sign legal agreements, you are part of the SV.CO program. Read on to learn about one of the most important tools available to you: [Verified Timelines](3-verified-timelines.md).

[^1]: Note, *Promoter* is just a legal term equivalent to Founder.
[^2]: Why? Because Partnerships are far easier to wind down, and you don't have to tackle the complex topic of equity distribution (Who owns how much?) when you start.
[^3]: All these are actual costs. One agreement with the all Founders & the actual Partnership itself. Partnerships have to be signed on ₹5000 stamp-papers, the other agreement is signed on ₹100 ones.
