# The Legal Agreement

Once your application is accepted, you sign a legal agreement between your founding team and Startup Village that lays out how the SV.CO platform will help you build great products, and what your team will offer SV.CO in return.

Note: everything in this page is a best-effort human-readable version of the legal agreement, but it does not replace the agreement you sign. If you have any doubts, please talk to your SV.CO representative.

Startup Village offers you:

* A curated online learning platform that describes the various stages that your go through while building your startup. Curated resources are also available to guide you through your journey. It has information on the common pitfalls that startups make at every stage and the most common activities that successful startups perform at every stage. In addition, a team of experts at Startup Village have curated learning material available into the five roles that every startup should have: a great *product-oriented* person, sound *engineering* skills, marketing and *sales*, good *governance*, and great *design* and user experience.
* A verified timeline where you can record life events in your startup journey. Startup Village will verify each of these events to make sure that an external investor or mentor can see your authentic startup journey.
* Access to funding events on separate selection criteria to be announced at each such event. As an example, we might have seed rounds where only startups in the Prototype and Customer Validation stages are eligible.
* Access to community events on a separate selection criteria. Startup Village plays host to dozens of events and expert visits a month. You can see a [small sample of them on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheStartupVillage).
* We have exciting mentorship programs that we are currently building. Teams who are in more advanced stages of their startup journey can apply for programs such as [Startup Studio](http://startupstudio.co.in).
* Office space at our Kochi and Vishakapatanam locations. Please note that there is a separate fee for access, and the fee structure for these spaces changes often.
* A Virtual Office address for all registered startups.
* Limited use of the Startup Village brand as per separate brand guidelines.

In return for these benefits, this is what your team will offer Startup Village:

* When you receive business leads to customers through our introductions, you agree to pay us 5% of the total revenue generated through that lead.
* When you are hired through our platform where we offer job fairs & placements, you'll agree to pay us 10% of your annual salary.
* When your team gets acqui-hired through our platform when we connect you to prospective companies, you'll agree to pay us 20% of your combined hiring bonus or annual salary (whichever is greater).
* When your team receives funding, you'll agree that Startup Village can participate in up to 30% of that funding round at a 30% discount on your funding valuation. This scenario is explained in detail in our [Raising Investment](6-raising-investment.md) chapter.

A note on the perks and rewards policy: we strongly believe that Startup Village will only succeed as an organization if our reward and fee-structure is **aligned with your success**. Case in point: our 30@30 scheme for funded startups does not ask for equity beforehand, only when you approach a funding round, and even then only after we put in money ourselves.

## Legal Agreements

There are two agreements that every founder has to sign:

* **Service Agreement with Founders**

   This is an agreement signed with the Founders of the startup that enforces the job referral and acqui-hire scenarios. This agreement is always signed with the startup founders.
  
* **Legal Agreement with Partnership**

   This additional agreement is with *a legal partnership firm* that founders have registered.
   
   Note: this requires founders to register a partnership. [We have a template Partnership Deed](http://www.slideshare.net/svlabs/startup-partnership-deed) available. This is not a very complex process: your SV.CO representative can help you start a partnership.
   
The agreements have added conditions regarding payment schedule for physical services, if for example, the startup chooses to use any of the physical space or resources available at our Kochi, Vizag or Kozhikode physical locations. 

**All agreements have a validity of 5 years.**

### Service Agreement with Founders

This is an agreement that is signed with each Founder[^1]:

### Legal Agreement with Partnership

This additional agreement is with *a legal partnership firm* that founders have registered:

Note: we have a [version of the agreement for founders who choose to register other corporate legal entities](http://www.slideshare.net/svlabs/physical-incubation-services-agreement-corporate) (like a Pvt. Ltd or an LLP) that you can sign instead. But we **strongly recommend** you start with a partnership firm if you are a first-time founder[^2].

## Signing the Agreement

Once you read and understand these agreements, write to help@sv.co or ping your SV.CO representative [on the Public Slack forum](1.2-slack.md) to arrange a date to visit Startup Village and sign these agreements.

All founders have to be present at Startup Village premises to sign agreements & should carry a valid Photo ID Proof.

## Fee

Fee = (Number of Founders * 100) + 100 + 5000[^3] 

## Next Steps
Once you sign legal agreements, you are part of the SV.CO program. Read on to learn about one of the most important tools available to you: [Verified Timelines](3-verified-timelines.md).

[^1]: Note, *Promoter* is just a legal term equivalent to Founder.
[^2]: Why? Because Partnerships are far easier to wind down, and you don't have to tackle the complex topic of equity distribution (Who owns how much?) when you start.
[^3]: All these are actual costs. One agreement with each founder, one agreement with the Partnership & the actual Partnership itself. Partnerships have to be signed on ₹5000 stamp-papers, others are signed on ₹100 ones.
