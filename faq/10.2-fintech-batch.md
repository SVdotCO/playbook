1. We're part of the Fintech Box program. Do we also get to be part of the GTU program?

   Yes! Everybody who is part of SV.CO is also part of the GTU program. [↵](#q-top)

2. I'm part of the Fintech Box program. Is it compulsory for us to attend the GTU program and pay the semester fees of Rs 15,000?

   It is compulsory to be part of the GTU programme. However, it’s automatic and no additional work has to be done. Your verified timeline will automatically be part of the GTU transcript at the end of the programme. However, because the Box programme is 6 months, you might not achieve any of the results required for a GTU specialization or certificate. That is fine! You can continue the programme at SV.CO even after you have returned the Fintech Boxes.

   For the Box campaign we are offering scholarships that will cover the Rs. 15,000 fee. [↵](#q-top)

3. How can Startup Village help us in raising investment? The present problem we face are lack of a server and development tools.

Also will we be receiving technical assistance from the bank?

   Yes, you will be receiving assistance from the bank and will have interactions with their team. Federal Bank is a great partner as they are open to new products and have set up a cross-division team to simplify approvals.

   All product intellectual-property will be owned by your startup. Federal Bank usually asks for a limited period of exclusivity and first-right of refusal for investing into your startup. [↵](#q-top)
