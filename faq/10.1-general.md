1. What should I include in the Deck during application submission?

   There is a great guide to what to include in [our Deck writeup](stages/5.1.1-deck.md). [↵](#q-top)

2. My co-founders accidentally created a startup application of their own. And I can't add them as co-founders now. How do I fix it?

   If they haven't yet submitted their application, ask your co-founders to click "Cancel Application"

   If they have submitted their application, ask your co-founders to delete their startup in their Startup Timeline.

   The Delete Startup is at the bottom of that page:

3. How are we guided and mentored?

   The SV.CO programme is intended as a self-learning platform for first-time founders. The Playbook provides a structured approach to developing products and defines stages that startups have to advance through & roles that every startup should have. Bi-weekly office hours with the Startup Village faculty, beginning with Engineering, Product and Marketing & Sales sessions will be part of the programme. [↵](#q-top)

4. Can I use a slide hosting service like Prezi instead of SlideShare, Speakerdeck et. al.?

   Of course. You can even specify a link to a PDF/PPT file you host somewhere. The idea is to have a permanent link, we're not particularly concerned about where you host it. [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-5"></cite>
5. Can you tell us more about the Gujarat University Scholarship?

   There is now a new page in the Playbook that talks about the [GTU partnership](1-partnership.md). [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-6"></cite>
6. Are we required to stick to the existing idea that we chose initially or do we have the freedom to explore into new areas?

   You can and probably will pivot. It’s up to you to make your startup a success. Don’t give up too soon though, and without great reasons. The [Idea Discovery section](stages/5.1-idea-discovery.md) has a lot more detail about questions such as these. [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-7"></cite>
7. How is our work to be tracked so as to ensure we are going at a proper pace?

   Through the [Verified Timeline](3-verified-timelines.md), which will also form the basis of a Transcript from our [GTU partnership](1-partnership.md). [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-8"></cite>
8. The playbook has detailed timing for each stages of a startup. Should we also follow this timing exactly?

   Startups advance at their own pace. The timing mentioned in the Playbook is just indicative of the average times founders usually take. The programme is milestone based (i.e. have you achieved everything to move up a stage?) and not time-bound. [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-9"></cite>   
9. How do I edit my timeline?

   Our timeline builder is still WIP. We'll have it ready soon! [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-10"></cite>   
10. Should we build the exact replica of our initial idea or are we free to add our own innovations to it?

   Do you want a search engine just like Google? Or do you want to build something better? [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-11"></cite>
11. What happens if we have to change the roles we chose?

    What happens when the CEO of Google changes? [↵](#q-top)
<cite id="q1-12"></cite>
12. As mentioned in the agreement, if we are to get a job through this program, what is the time period that we have to pay SV.CO 10% of our annual salary? Is it for one year or more? If we do not accept the job offer, do we need to pay the amount?

    You have to pay 10% CTC for the first year. If you don’t take up the job offer, you don’t have to pay SV.CO anything. Our fee is based on the model that when you succeed, we do. [↵](#q-top)
